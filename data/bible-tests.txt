God is good.
God is merciful and gracious.
God is rich in lovingkindness.
God, who is rich in mercy, loves us.
Shem, Ham, and Japheth boarded the ark.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son.
Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.
